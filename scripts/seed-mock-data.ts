This shift represents a fundamental change in how we think about luxury real estate on the Costa del Sol. The new benchmark isn't just about amenities‚Äîit's about architectural integrity, sustainable materials, and spaces that enhance daily living.

Recent developments along the Golden Mile exemplify this trend: clean lines replacing ornate excess, natural materials chosen for their longevity and beauty, and layouts that prioritize flow and light over formal rooms that go unused.`,

Our approach involves careful consideration of orientation, strategic placement of glazing, and the integration of traditional shading techniques adapted for contemporary living. Deep overhangs, retractable louvers, and planted terraces all play a role in creating comfortable interiors that maintain visual connection with the landscape.

The goal is spaces that feel bright and open without becoming greenhouses‚Äîa balance that requires both technical knowledge and sensitivity to the specific qualities of Mediterranean light throughout the day and across seasons.`,

For morning coffee, we recommend the terrace at Caf√© del Mar. Evenings call for the seasonal menu at Skina (two Michelin stars) or the more relaxed atmosphere of Casanis Bistrot. The weekly market at Puerto Ban√∫s offers exceptional produce and a glimpse into local life.

Wellness options abound: the spa at Puente Romano, yoga sessions at Mantra, or simply walking the coastal path that connects the neighborhood's beaches. This is living well, Costa del Sol style.`,

We've developed relationships with quarries throughout Spain that meet our standards for both quality and sustainability. The limestone we used in Sierra Horizon came from a family-run quarry in Valencia that's been operating responsibly for generations. The terrazzo in Loma Azul incorporates recycled marble from a renovation in M√°laga.

This attention to provenance doesn't just reduce environmental impact‚Äîit also ensures we're working with materials that have genuine character and will age beautifully over time.`,
