## âœ… Ready for Admin Dashboard Development

All database connections are properly configured and tested. We can now safely build:

1. **Admin Authentication** - Supabase Auth is ready
2. **CRUD Operations** - Drizzle ORM working for all tables
3. **File Uploads** - Can integrate Supabase Storage
4. **Content Management** - All tables accessible

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Set up admin authentication and authorization
2. Build admin dashboard UI
3. Create CRUD interfaces for:
   - Projects
   - Editorials
   - Listings
   - Site settings
4. Add image upload functionality
5. Build publishing workflows

**Note:** The `.execute()` raw SQL queries showed method signature issues, but standard Drizzle ORM queries work perfectly. We'll use Drizzle's query builder for all admin operations.
