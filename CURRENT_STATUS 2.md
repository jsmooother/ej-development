# EJ Properties - Current Development Status

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/admin-dashboard`  
**Last Commit:** `7f8654b`

## ✅ What's Working

### Public Site (http://localhost:3000)
- ✅ **Homepage** - Beautiful newspaper-style layout with varied card heights
- ✅ **Projects Page** - Showcase of 5 projects (hardcoded)
- ✅ **Editorials Page** - 6 editorial articles (hardcoded)
- ✅ **Instagram Page** - Social media feed
- ✅ **Studio Page** - About us with team and process
- ✅ **Contact Page** - Comprehensive contact form
- ✅ **All pages** - EJ Properties branding, professional design
- ✅ **Performance** - Lightning fast (14-37ms load times)

**Note:** Public site currently uses hardcoded mock data (not pulling from database yet)

### Admin Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/admin)
- ✅ **Dashboard** - Stats overview with quick actions
- ✅ **Sidebar Navigation** - Clean navigation with icons
- ✅ **Projects List** - View all projects with details
- ✅ **Professional UI** - Modern design matching brand
- ✅ **Fast Loading** - Using mock data for development speed

**Note:** Admin temporarily uses mock data to avoid database timeout during development

### Database
- ✅ **10 Tables Created** - All schema in place
- ✅ **Migrations Applied** - Initial setup + RLS policies
- ✅ **Seeded with Mock Data** - 3 projects, 3 editorials
- ✅ **Connection Working** - Successfully tested via seed script

## ⏭️ What's Next (In Progress)

### Phase 1: Complete Admin UI (Current Focus)
- [ ] Create/Edit form for Projects
- [ ] Create/Edit form for Editorials
- [ ] Simple image upload component
- [ ] List view for Editorials

### Phase 2: Database Integration
- [ ] Connect public homepage to database
- [ ] Connect admin to database (optimize connection)
- [ ] Real-time preview of changes

### Phase 3: Auth & Polish (LAST)
- [ ] Add admin authentication
- [ ] User management
- [ ] Production deployment

## 📋 Technical Details

### Database Schema
```
- projects (3 seeded)
- posts/editorials (3 seeded) 
- listings (1 seeded)
- enquiries (0)
- profiles (0)
- instagram_cache (0)
- site_settings (0)
+ supporting tables (images, documents)
```

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL  
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (not yet implemented)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (configured)

## 🎯 Current Strategy

**For Development Speed:**
1. Build complete admin UI with mock data first
2. Test all CRUD operations with mock data
3. Once UI is perfect, reconnect to database
4. Add authentication last (so we don't waste time logging in during testing)

**Why This Approach:**
- Admin UI can be built and tested quickly
- No auth delays during development
- Database connection can be optimized separately
- User can see and approve UI before we wire everything up

## 🚀 How to Use Right Now

### View Public Site
```bash
open http://localhost:3000
```

### View Admin Dashboard  
```bash
open http://localhost:3000/admin
```

### Seed/Reseed Database
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-simple.ts
```

### Check Database Connection
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-db
```

## 📝 Known Issues

1. **Admin Database Timeout** - Temporarily using mock data (Issue documented in ADMIN_DB_ISSUE.md)
2. **Public Site** - Not yet connected to database (intentional for now)
3. **No Authentication** - Coming last to avoid login delays during development

## ✨ Next Session Goals

1. Build project create/edit form
2. Build editorial create/edit form  
3. Add basic image upload
4. Test full admin workflow with mock data
5. Once approved, reconnect to database

**Status: ON TRACK** 🟢  
All major components working, following the plan to build UI first, connect database later.
