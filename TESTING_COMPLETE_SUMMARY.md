## 🎯 Simple 5-Step Browser Test

### Step 1: Open DevTools
- Press `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows)
- Go to Console tab

### Step 2: Verify Initial State
**Admin page** should show:
- 5 projects
- 4 with green toggle (Live)
- 1 with gray toggle (Draft - "The Nest")

**Public page** should show:
- 4 projects only
- "The Nest" is NOT visible

### Step 3: Test Live → Draft
- In admin, click "No1 Östermalm" toggle
- Should turn GRAY, label says "Draft"
- Refresh public page → only 3 projects visible

### Step 4: Test Draft → Live
- In admin, click "The Nest" toggle
- Should turn GREEN, label says "Live"
- Refresh public page → 4 projects visible (The Nest appears)

### Step 5: Verify Persistence
- Toggle both back to original state
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Status should be unchanged

---

## ✅ What Success Looks Like

### Visual
- ✅ Smooth toggle animation (green ↔ gray)
- ✅ Clear labels ("Live" ↔ "Draft")
- ✅ No page jumps or glitches

### Functionality
- ✅ Draft projects hidden from public
- ✅ Live projects shown on public
- ✅ Status persists after refresh

### Console
- ✅ Success messages with ✅ symbols
- ✅ No red error messages
- ✅ Proper logging at each step

---

## 📸 Quick Screenshots to Take

Just take these 4 screenshots:

1. **Admin - Before** (showing all 5 projects with initial state)
2. **Public - Before** (showing 4 projects)
3. **Admin - After Toggle** (showing status change)
4. **Public - After Toggle** (showing visibility change)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If toggle doesn't work:
```bash
# Check database state
npx tsx scripts/check-projects.ts

# Run automated test to verify backend
./scripts/test-status.sh

# Hard refresh browser
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Windows)
```

### If public page shows drafts:
1. Did you actually refresh the page? (Cmd+R)
2. Check console for "After filtering: X published projects"
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### If status doesn't persist:
1. Check console for errors (red text)
2. Verify server is still running
3. Run: `./scripts/test-status.sh` to check database
