# Preview Feature & Hero Image Selection - Complete âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Project Preview Modal
Created a beautiful, full-featured preview modal that shows exactly how a project will look on the frontend.

**Features:**
- âœ… Full-screen modal with smooth animations
- âœ… Close with Escape key or X button
- âœ… Prevents background scrolling when open
- âœ… Shows published/draft status badge
- âœ… "Open Live Page" button for published projects
- âœ… Real-time preview of all project content:
  - Hero image
  - Title and summary
  - Project facts grid
  - Full description
  - Before/after image pairs
  - Gallery images

**File:** `src/components/admin/project-preview-modal.tsx`

### 2. Preview Button on Edit Page
Added a floating preview button to the project edit page.

**Features:**
- âœ… Fixed position (bottom-right corner)
- âœ… Beautiful blue rounded button with eye icon
- âœ… Shows real-time changes as you edit
- âœ… Auto-save works independently of preview
- âœ… Preview updates with latest data

**File:** `src/app/(admin)/admin/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

### 3. Preview Button on New Project Page
Added the same preview functionality to the new project creation page.

**Features:**
- âœ… Preview works even before saving
- âœ… All form fields are now controlled (state-based)
- âœ… Real-time preview as you type
- âœ… Shows "Untitled Project" placeholder if no title

**File:** `src/app/(admin)/admin/projects/new/page.tsx`

### 4. Hero Image Selection - FIXED! ðŸŽ‰
**The hero image selection was not working** - it was showing UI but not actually setting the hero image. Now it's fully functional!

**What Was Fixed:**
- âœ… Added `heroImageUrl` prop to `ProjectImagesManager`
- âœ… Added `onHeroImageChange` callback
- âœ… Connected hero image selection to auto-save
- âœ… Visual feedback when selecting hero image:
  - Yellow border and ring
  - Star icon overlay
  - 20% yellow tint
- âœ… Click any image to set as hero
- âœ… Works on both edit and new project pages

**Files:**
- `src/components/admin/project-images-manager.tsx`
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/projects/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(admin)/admin/projects/new/page.tsx`

### 5. Sample Data Import
Created a one-time import script that populated the database with 5 complete sample projects.

**Projects Imported:**
1. Modern Villa Renovation (280 sqm, 4 bed, 3 bath)
2. Luxury Apartment Redesign (120 sqm, 2 bed, 2 bath)
3. Family Home Extension (200 sqm, 3 bed, 2 bath)
4. Historic Townhouse Restoration (180 sqm, 3 bed, 2 bath)

## Technical Details

### Preview Modal Architecture
- **Portal-based**: Renders in a fixed overlay
- **Keyboard accessible**: Escape to close
- **Prevents scroll**: Locks background when open
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Image optimization**: Uses Next.js Image component

### Hero Image Flow
1. User uploads images â†’ stored in `projectImages` array
2. User clicks image in Step 2 â†’ `onHeroImageChange(url)` called
3. URL stored in `heroImagePath` field
4. Auto-save triggered (edit page)
5. Hero image used for:
   - Project cards on listing pages
   - Main image on project detail page
   - Preview modal

### State Management
- **Edit Page**: Uses `project` state object, auto-saves on change
- **New Page**: Uses individual state variables for each field
- **Preview**: Reads from current state, no API calls needed
