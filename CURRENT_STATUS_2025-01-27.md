## 🔍 **Current Investigation: User Email System**

### **Issue Identified** ❌
**User creation system does NOT send emails to new users**

### **Current User Creation Process:**
1. Admin creates user via `/api/admin/users` endpoint
2. User created in Supabase Auth with `email_confirm: true` (auto-confirmed)
3. Profile created in database with role
4. **NO email sent to new user**
5. **NO password set for new user**
6. **NO login instructions provided**

### **Problems:**
- Users can't log in (no password)
- Users don't know they've been added
- No onboarding process
- No way to set initial password

### **Files Analyzed:**
- `src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts` - User creation API
- `src/components/admin/user-modal.tsx` - Admin UI for user creation
- `scripts/create-editor-user.ts` - Script-based user creation
- `scripts/create-first-admin.ts` - Admin user creation script

## 🚀 **Next Steps (When Resuming)**

### **Priority 1: Fix User Email System**
1. **Add email notification service** (SendGrid, Resend, or similar)
2. **Create welcome email template** with login instructions
3. **Implement password setup flow** (invitation or reset)
4. **Add user onboarding process**

### **Options to Consider:**
- **Option A**: Use Supabase Auth invitations (`inviteUserByEmail`)
- **Option B**: Custom email service with welcome emails
- **Option C**: Manual process with admin instructions

### **Priority 2: Testing & Validation**
1. **Test user creation flow** end-to-end
2. **Verify email delivery** works correctly
3. **Test login process** for new users
4. **Validate role permissions** work as expected

## 📁 **Git Status**
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: Clean working tree
- **Last commit**: `4649394` - "feat: standardize all tag UI with Apple-like design"
- **All changes**: Committed and pushed to GitHub

## 🛠 **Technical Environment**
- **Local server**: Not running (was stopped)
- **Database**: Connected and working
- **Supabase**: Configured and operational
- **Dependencies**: All up to date

## 📝 **Notes for Next Session**
- User email system is the main blocker
- Image management system is complete and working well
- All recent UI improvements are production-ready
- Need to implement proper user onboarding flow
