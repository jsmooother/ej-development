4. Run: `./scripts/test-status.sh` to verify database

### Public page still shows draft
1. Check: Did you actually refresh the page?
2. Try: Clear browser cache
3. Verify: Console shows "After filtering" message
4. Check: Database state with `npx tsx scripts/check-projects.ts`

### Status doesn't persist
1. Check: Network tab for failed requests
2. Verify: Database connection is working
3. Run: `./scripts/test-status.sh` to test backend
4. Check: No errors in server terminal
