- Listings         ✅
- Instagram        ✅ (admin only)
- Analytics        ✅ (admin only)

## Permission Enforcement

### Layer 1: UI (Sidebar)
- Navigation items marked `adminOnly: true` are hidden from editors
- Editors don't see links to restricted pages

### Layer 2: Middleware
- All `/admin/*` routes require authentication
- Redirects to login if not authenticated

### Layer 3: API Routes
- Admin-only routes use `requireAdmin()` helper
- Returns 403 Forbidden if editor tries to access
- Returns 401 Unauthorized if not logged in

### Layer 4: Database (RLS)
- PostgreSQL policies enforce permissions at data level
- Editors cannot query restricted tables
- Admins have full database access via policies
